各位同事，女士们，先生们：

非常高兴出席今天的发布会，祝贺中国国际发展知识中心（the Center for International Knowledge on Development (CIKD)）发布首期《全球发展报告》。

发展是人类社会的永恒主题，是时代进步的重要标尺。习近平主席在2015 年联合国发展峰会上指出，对各国人民而言，发展寄托着生存和希望，象征着尊严和权利。

也正是在发展峰会上，各国领导人一致通过 2030 年可持续发展议程，为全球发展事业制定了行动蓝图，开启了国际发展合作新航程。

七年弹指一挥间，落实 2030 年议程的时间已过近半。在各方共同努力下，全球发展事业取得积极进展，但也面临百年变局带来的空前挑战。全球疫情、地区冲突、大国博弈、逆全球化等复杂因素相互交织。 

全球减贫进程严重受挫，超过 8 亿人仍然生活在极端贫困之中。更令人担忧的是，发展问题在国际议程中日益被边缘化，发达国家援助义务远未落实，全球发展资源缺口巨大，如期实现可持续发展目标不容乐观。

在此历史关头，习近平主席站在全人类福祉的高度，在联合国提出全球发展倡议，以构建全球发展共同体为目标，秉持发展优先、以人民为中心等理念，推动加快落实 2030 年议程，致力实现更加强劲、绿色、健康的全球发展。倡议一经提出，便获得 100 多个国家的热烈响应和坚定支持。

全球发展倡议吹响了聚焦发展的“集结号”，推动发展问题回归国际核心议程；倡议铺设了促进发展的“快车道”，为各方对接发展政策和深化务实合作搭建有效平台；

倡议提供了落实2030 年议程的“加速器”， 为汇聚各方资源、破解发展难题、促进协同增效注入强劲动力。本周，习近平主席将主持全球发展高层对话会，和新兴市场和发展中国家领导人一起，共商全球发展大计，推动国际发展合作“再出发”。
