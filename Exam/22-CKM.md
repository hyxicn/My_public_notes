## Learning Objectives

* 01 Introduction

* 02 Knowledge Creation
     - describe nature of knowledge
     - distinguish different types of knowledge
         - explicit vs. tacit knowledge
         - declarative vs. procedural knowledge
     - describe exploration and exploitation as two different learning models
     - understand SECI model as a theory of organizational knowledge creation
     - understand the concept of "Ba" as a foundation for the knowledge spiral

* 03 Knowledge Processes: Knowledge Transfer
     - describe the challenges of knowledge transfer 
     - learn about dimensions of communication channels
     - understand and describe knowledge transfer through channels represented by Communities of Practice, lessons learned, best practices, and team composition
     - explain the Media Synchronicity Theory and apply it to example cases

* 04 Knowledge Processes: Knowledge Storage and Retrieval
     - explain the implications of different degrees of codification
     -  describe digital transactive memory systems as a technology to retrieve knowledge
     - explain different text minning functionality
     - understand data warehouses as the storage location of structured data
     - explain different business intelligence analysis methods (OLAP and data mining)
      
* 05 @AI Siemens

* 06 The Effects of AI Systems on KM
     - Understand basic of ML techniques
     - How do ML techniques influence knowledge in organizations?
     - How does ML influence the KM cycle (storage, retrieval, creation, transfer)?
     - How does ML change the introduction of KMS?
      
* 07 Designing Knowledge Management Systems(1)
     - Explain the influence of contingency factors on the adequate design of a KMS
     - Describe different design approaches to KMS
     - Apply different design approaches to KMS:
        - Analyze case information regarding contingency factors
        - Deduce design principles resulting from the identified contingency factors
     - Understand and describe similarities and differences between the design approaches
     - Discuss your approach to designing a KMS for a given case
* 08 Designing Knowledge Management Systems(2)
* 09 The Use of Knowledge Management Systems
     - describe the challenges of knowledge transfer 
     - learn about dimensions of communication channels
     - understand and describe knowledge transfer through channels represented by Communities of Practice, lessons learned, best practices, and team composition
     - explain the Media Synchronicity Theory and apply it to example cases
