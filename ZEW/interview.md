”The research area “Fiscal Policy, Federalism and Economic Performance” is dedicated to analysing **federal systems, fiscal governance, and the correlations between fiscal policy and economic performance**. Determining which federal policies and supporting measures and institutions encourage economic performance is a key research concern. National policy arrangements (such as Germany’s financial equalisation scheme and the debt brake) are considered here along with European ones (including the division of responsibilities between the EU and its Member States, fiscal contracts, etc.).“

### Self-intro

* Major, minor
* Impression about Mannheim

### Motivation

* Get my hands dirty. 
* Apply my knowledge from study in actual reseach projects
* Identity my blind spots during study. (How to find a valid IV? What if exogeneity assumption fails? What about OVB? What can we do if some data is important but it is not available) 
* Putting my skills to work will help me find my future career path (e.g. I have a few research interests (like systematic risk management, banking regulations, interaction between fiscal and monetary policy, but I not sure about my PhD research topic)
* Research in a institution v.s. University. What's the difference?
* **Interesed in Fiscal policy research and regulations in general**
    * 目前欧洲热议的财政政策是什么？
    * 不同的财政政策会对欧元区的宏观经济产生什么样的影响？
    * 在欧元贬值的背景下，货币政策未来如何变动，财政政策是否会和欧元货币政策联动？
    * 德国的财政政策和欧盟财政政策之间的关系

### Expectation

* Get my hands dirty. Learn why and know how to do?
* Attend some seminars. Immerse myself into real research working atmosphere. Find out what I might like or dislike.
* Networks. Get to know more researchers and what're their impression on working as a economic researcher in Non-government-organization

### Q&A

* Why Fiscal institution? How do you find your career path or specific research interest?

* Student assistant v.s. Internship (apart from workload)
* Preparation: In order to better prepare for my work. Would you recommend some reading materials ?
* Max for 3 month? Can I extend?
