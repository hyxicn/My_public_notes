## Words senses

1. How do we know when a word has more than one sense? 

    **Zeugma test**
    
    ### Example
    
    Which flights serve breakfast?
    
    Does Lufthansa serve Philadelphia?
    
    ?Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and Philadelphia?
    
    Since this conjunction sounds weird, we say that these are two different senses of serve.
 
## Words relationships

* Word Relations
  * Homonymy 一词多义
  * Polysemy 近义词
  * Metonymy [转喻](https://www.zhihu.com/question/19766649)
  * Synonyms 同义词
  * Antonyms 反义词
  * Autoantonyms 自反意词
  * Hyponymy and Hypernymy 上下位关系
    * Hyponym/Subordinate
    * Hypernym/Superordinate 
  * Meronymy and Holonymy 部份整体关系
    * Meronym 部份
    * Holonym 整体

  ### Examples

  * Car is a **hyponym** of vehicle.
  
  * Vehicle is a **hypernym** of car.
  
  * Wheel is a **meronym** of car, and car is a **holonym** of wheel.
 
  ### Causion
  
  * There are almost NO perferct synonymy examples. (large ≠ big in all sentences.
  
  * Synonymy is a relation between senses rather than words.
