#### Challenges and solutions for NLP?

1. Specify the challenge for NLP?

- Ambiguity 模糊表达
- non-standard English
- Neologisms 新词（网络词)
- Segmentation issues 正确断句
- World knowledge 缺乏背景知识
- Idioms 习语
- Tricky entity names

2. What is the potential solution？

Probabilistic models built from language data

- Models
State machines\
Rule systems\
Probabilistic models\
Vector-space models
- Algorithms
