# An Odyssey to Macro Finance

### Introduction

I buit this document to record how I dive into Macro Finance research feild.

I choose macro finance because I am interested in the following questions.

* Why economists can not resolve financial crisis? 
* What is money?
* How do monetary and fiscal policy crash people's daily life?
* How to deal with systematic financial risk?
* How to guard for the financial stability in a more connected international world?
